A   wide   range   of   interdisciplinary   co-operations   between  diverse  research  groups  of  the  GRK  was  estab-lished (some initiated by the graduates themselves), ena-bling  the  exchange  of  scientific  expertise  and  the  shared  use  of  equipment.

I presented a [poster](https://poster.com/) **COMPUTATIONAL ANALYSIS OF CONFORMATIONAL CHANGES IN GSK3-Β/CDK2 KINASES FOR UNDERSTANDING INHIBITOR
SELECTIVITY.**.

ABSTRACT:

GSK3β and CDK2 are highly homologous kinases showing high sequence identity especially in the kinase domain and the ATP‘s binding pocket. This similarity makes the task of developing GSK3β-selective inhibitor challenging. Depending on inhibitors developed in the group of PD Dr. Hilgeroth, computational chemistry methods are applied to get insight in the inhibitor binding, to predict the conformational changes, and to generate predictive models for estimating the binding affinity of novel compounds. The application of the binding free energy method LIE taking into consideration the P-loop flexibility was successful in generating predictive model to explain the varying activity of Fluorene derivatives. Additionally, MD simulation combined with the analysis of trajectories helped to understand the factors that affect the binding affinity. The models can now be applied to further optimize the inhibitor profile.
