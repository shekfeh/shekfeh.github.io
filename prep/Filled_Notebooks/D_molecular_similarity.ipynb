        "\n",
        "- How are molecules represented on computers for cheminformatics applications?\n",
        "\n",
        "- How can I measure the similarity of two molecules?\n",
        "\n",
        "- How can I find out if a molecule contains a particular substructure?\n",

        "\n",
        "- Learn about graph representation of molecules.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Learn about molecular fingerprints.\n",

        "Cheminformatics is often used in the context of molecular discovery.\n",
        "For example, you might want to process a large number of molecules to find molecules that are similar to a target, or that contain a particular functional group.\n",
        "But how can you tell if two molecules are similar?\n",
        "\n",
        "A chemist looking at two molecules might be able to make a judgment based on their chemical knowledge. However, when dealing with a large number of molecules, this problem can become intractable. There are ways to detect molecular similarity on a computer that allow fast comparison and processing of molecules.\n",

        "## Graph Representation of Molecules\n",
        "\n",
        "Graph theory is a branch of mathematics that studies the properties and applications of graphs, which are structures made up of nodes (or vertices) connected by edges (or lines).\n",
        "A molecule can be represented as a graph where atoms are nodes and bonds are edges. This representation allows the use of various graph-based algorithms to analyze molecular structures.\n",

        "Image from [Wikipedia: Graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory)\n",
        "\n",
        "As a chemist, you probably don't have a hard time imagining a molecule as a graph. The atoms would be \"nodes\" in the graph, while the bonds would be \"edges\".\n",
        "One can also represent bond order by changing the \"weight\" of graph edges.\n",
        "In this view, one way to tell if molecules are the same is to check that their molecular graphs are the same.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Substructure Searches\n",
        "\n",
        "A substructure search is a cheminformatics technique used to identify molecules that contain a specific pattern or structure within a larger molecule.\n",

        "</div>\n",
        "\n",
        "One way this can be done is with graph representation and graph theory.\n",
        "When doing substructure search using RDKit, it can check to see if the molecular graph for one molecule contains the molecular graph of a smaller molecule.\n",
        "This is a concept called \"**subgraph isomorphism**\". You can see more about this topic in this [presentation](https://www.rdkit.org/UGM/2012/Landrum_RDKit_UGM.Fingerprints.Final.pptx.pdf).\n",
        "\n",
        "This is all very nice information, but you actually don't have to fully understand it in order to do a substructure search. In the cells below, we demonstrate searching molecules for a smaller structure using substructure search. As you can see from the cells, this functionality is very nicely built into RDKit.\n"
