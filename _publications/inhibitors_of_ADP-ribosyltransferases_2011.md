excerpt: 'ADP-ribosyltransferases (ADP-RTs) use NAD+ to transfer an ADP-ribosyl group to target proteins. Although some ADP-RTs are bacterial toxins only few inhibitors are known. Here we present the development of fluorescence-based assays and a focussed library screening using kinase inhibitors as a new approach towards inhibitors of ADP-RTs. Docking and GBSA scoring were used to understand the interactions between the toxin proteins and the inhibitors.'
