title: "“Drug-likeness” properties of natural compounds"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/Drug_Likeness_2020
excerpt: 'Our previous work was focused on the fundamental physical and chemical concepts behind “drug-likeness” and “natural product (NP)-likeness”. Herein, we discuss further details on the concepts of “drug-likeness”, “lead-likeness” and “NP-likeness”. The discussion will first focus on NPs as drugs, then a discussion of previous studies in which the complexities of the scaffolds and chemical space of naturally occurring compounds have been compared with synthetic, semisynthetic compounds and the Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs. This is followed by guiding principles for designing “drug-like” natural product libraries for lead compound discovery purposes. In addition, we present a tool for measuring “NP-likeness” of compounds and a brief presentation of machine-learning approaches. A binary quantitative structure-activity relationship for classifying drugs from nondrugs and natural compounds from nonnatural ones is also described. While the studies add to the plethora of recently published works on the “drug-likeness” of NPs, it no doubt increases our understanding of the physicochemical properties that make NPs fall within the ranges associated with “drug-like” molecules.'
