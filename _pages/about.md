In my career, I've delved into a diverse array of projects that have fueled my passion for pharmaceutical research. Among them:

 * Tackling the challenge of Mastocytosis/GIST's targeted therapy resistance driven by the mutant D816V c-KIT Tyrosine kinase.
 * Unraveling the intricacies of Kinase inhibitors' selectivity, particularly against GSK3beta/CDK2 kinases.
 * Employing cutting-edge methodologies like Linear Interaction Energy (LIE) and MM-PBSA to delve into the dynamics of Protein Kinases.
 * Utilizing virtual screening techniques to unearth potential enzyme inhibitors, pushing the boundaries of drug discovery.
 * Spearheading the discovery and refinement of Histone-Acetyltransferase (HAT) inhibitors, driven by a relentless pursuit of innovation.
 * Pioneering the identification and enhancement of novel inhibitors targeting mPGES-1, Acetyl-Choline-Esterase, and Tyrosinase.
 * Leveraging structure-based methods such as Docking and Molecular Dynamics to gain insights into molecular interactions.
 * Exploring the realm of drug delivery systems, controlled release mechanisms, and polymer sciences for enhanced therapeutic outcomes.
 * Navigating the complexities of Cheminformatics, Chemometrics, and chemical data management to extract meaningful insights.
 * Harnessing the power of R, Python, and SQL for robust data processing and analysis.
 * Mastering chromatography, spectrometry, and analytical chemistry techniques to validate and refine our discoveries.

My passion lies in the convergence of several key areas within the pharmaceutical landscape. Epigenetic Targets, such as HAT and HDAC, captivate me with their potential to reshape therapeutic paradigms. Similarly, the nuanced interplay between protein kinases' flexibility and the selectivity of kinase inhibitors presents an intellectually stimulating challenge. I'm also deeply intrigued by GPCRs, P-glycoprotein, and the intricate dynamics of the blood-brain barrier.

Throughout my journey, my primary focus has been on leveraging virtual screening methodologies to craft novel enzyme inhibitors, with a keen eye on solving the solvation problem. This has led me to explore the subtle nuances between implicit and explicit solvent models, particularly in the context of Epigenetic targets. As my research evolved, I shifted gears towards unraveling the mysteries of kinase inhibitor selectivity, employing a fusion of Chem-bioinformatic methods to drive drug discovery forward. From docking scoring to predicting binding affinities, I'm driven by an unwavering commitment to pushing the boundaries of pharmaceutical innovation.
