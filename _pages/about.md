<img src="/images/logo1.png" alt="md" width="140px" align="left" style="padding:10px;"> Some of the projects I worked with:

1- Overcoming the resistance to Mastocytosis/GIST's targeted therapy by the mutant D816V c-KIT Tyrosine kinase.

2- Understanding the selectivity of Kinase inhibitors against GSK3beta/CDK2 kinases.

3- Linear Interaction Energy (LIE) and MM-PBSA methods applied to the Protein Kinases.

4- Virtual screening for discovering novel enzyme inhibitors.

5- Discovery and optimization of novel Histone-Acetyltransferase (HAT) inhibitors.

6- Discovery and optimization of novel mPGES-1 inhibitors, Acetyl-Choline-Esterase inhibitors and Tyrosinase inhibitors.

7- Application of structure-based methods, e.g. Docking and Molecular Dynamics (Amber and Gromacs).

8- Drug delivery systems / Controled release DDS / Polymers .

9- Cheminformatics, Chemometrics, and chemical data managment.

10- Data processing using R/Python/SQL.
11- Chromatography, Spectrometry, and analytical chemical methods.


Pharmaceutical Interests: Epigenetic Targets (HAT and HDAC), Kinases : flexibility of protein kinases and selectivity of kinase inhibitors, GPCRs, P-glycoprotein and blood brain barrier.


The real focus of my work was applying virtual screening for developing and designing novel enzyme Inhibitors with focus on the solvation problem and the comparison between the implicit solvents models (PBSA/GBSA methods) and the explicit solvent methods; e.g. Linear Interaction Energy; applied to Epigentic targets. Later, I moved to another research area : the problem of Kinase inhibitors' selectivity, Application of Chem-bioinformatic methods for drug discovery, docking scoring, physics-based binding energy estimation, predicting the right binding mode with the right protein conformation and the prediction of the binding affinity.

<img src="/images/teach.jpeg" alt="md" width="140px" align="left" style="padding:10px;"> In addition to my research, I have an experience in teaching. I was a course instructor for [Computational Modeling in Physics](https://utm.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/phy426h5). Over the years, I have had the opportunity to teach various university courses in physics, mathematics, programming, and chemistry as a teaching assistant. [Find my selected tutorials](/teaching/).
