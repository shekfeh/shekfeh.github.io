In my career, I've delved into a diverse array of projects that have fueled my passion for pharmaceutical research. Among them:

 * Tackling the challenge of Mastocytosis/GIST's targeted therapy resistance driven by the mutant D816V c-KIT Tyrosine kinase.
 * Unraveling the intricacies of Kinase inhibitors' selectivity, particularly against GSK3beta/CDK2 kinases.
 * Employing fast physics-based methodologies like Linear Interaction Energy (LIE) and MM-PBSA to delve into the dynamics of Protein Kinases.
 * Utilizing virtual screening techniques to unearth potential enzyme inhibitors, pushing the boundaries of drug discovery.
 * Spearheading the discovery and refinement of Histone-Acetyltransferase (HAT) inhibitors, driven by a relentless pursuit of innovation.
 * Pioneering the identification and enhancement of novel inhibitors targeting mPGES-1, Acetyl-Choline-Esterase, and Tyrosinase.
 * Leveraging structure-based methods such as Docking and Molecular Dynamics to gain insights into molecular interactions.
 * Exploring the realm of drug delivery systems, controlled release mechanisms, and polymer sciences for enhanced therapeutic outcomes.
 * Navigating the complexities of Cheminformatics, Chemometrics, and chemical data management to extract meaningful insights.
 * Harnessing the power of R, Python, and SQL for robust data processing and analysis.
 * Mastering chromatography, spectrometry, and analytical chemistry techniques to validate and refine our discoveries.
